# Code

We try to create clean and readable code. If you want to know about clean code, you can read this book [https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/). To create a clean code please spend your time to read the following rules:

1.  Use **camelCase** to name your variable and fucntion.
2.  Use **UpperCase** to name your class
3.  Name of variable, function, parameter, class must clear and easy to understand (good : var car, don't : var x)
4.  Try to avoid the flag in if statement > **if (x == 0); please create like this one -> if (isReady)**

If you have an idea to make this rule better, feel free to fix or add it :)
